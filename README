CardioXML2HL7


Introduction
------------
Sample code using the Ruby-HL7 module to parse Resting EKG XML files from GEHC CardioSoft/MAC carts to generate HL7 ORU messages.
This tool was used as a proof of concept but it can be easily adapted to suit your needs.

Included are two sample XML files with dummy data.

=> Usage: ruby cardio_XML_HL7.rb InputFile.xml


NOTE: 
To send HL7 messages to your integration engine open the file
and change the IP Address and the Port number.

#To send message via TCP/IP
soc = TCPSocket.open( "192.XXX.X.XXX", 6661 )
